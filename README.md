## Activity-recognition-using-federated-transfer-learning
SVM and Fully connected neural network models are initially trained on the private dataset and later predictions are made using these on the public dataset, thus exploring the scope of federated learning.

## Dataset
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]

## How to run the code?
1. Download the file attached then open the file in jupyter notebook.

2. Download the dataset from above

s and provide its path instead of the path we provided in our code.
3. Now run code by clicking on the run button at each cell (or use shift + enter) or by using
the run all option (these options are available under the Cell submenu at the top)
